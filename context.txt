Taken into consideration **Critical Relationships for SQL Generation**:
    1. Student Journey
        Student(1) → (1)Profile [One-to-One]
        Student(1) → (1)UniversityPosition [One-to-One]
        Student(1) → (Many)Records [One-to-Many]
        Student(1) → (Many)Takes [Current Enrollments]

    2. Course Ecosystem
        Department(1) → (Many)Courses [One-to-Many]
        Course(1) → (Many)Teachers [Through Junction]
        Instructor(1) → (Many)Courses [Through Junction]

    3. Data Flow Rules
        Takes → Records (Annual Migration)
        - At year-end: All Takes records moved to Records
        - Post-migration: Takes table cleared for new enrollments
        - Records become permanent academic history
